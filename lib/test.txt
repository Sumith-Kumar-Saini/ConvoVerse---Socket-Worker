The drifting hum of half-formed notions spills into a slow crawl of wandering impressions where the edges of thoughts dissolve into each other like colors bleeding through damp paper, unbothered by coherence, sliding past memories of imaginary corridors lined with mismatched clocks ticking at uneven intervals, each beat wobbling like a loose bicycle wheel rolling through soft sand while a faint smell of chipped paint mingles with the echo of someone humming a tune that never settles into a melody, floating somewhere above the flicker of a neon sign that blinks out of habit rather than purpose, throwing its quiet stutter onto a pavement that feels warmer on one side as if the sun had forgotten to even out its attentions, leaving patches of lingering warmth clinging to the texture of cracked asphalt where tiny weeds stretch upward without expecting anything in return as drifting shadows swell and shrink like jellyfish basking in nonexistent tides, blending into a fog of ideas about tin cups filled with air pretending to be soup and the soft rustle of feathers that aren’t actually feathers but bits of fluff carried by a draft that may or may not come from a door that may or may not exist, all while a faint vibration pulses underfoot as though the floor itself is dreaming about distant engines murmuring through layers of time-soaked fabric draped lazily over a chair that somehow manages to remember every moment someone ever sat on it, storing those impressions deep in the grain of its frame even as the corners accumulate dust shaped like miniature landscapes with hills so tiny they crumble at the slightest exhale, drifting toward a windowsill where faint scratches form patterns reminiscent of constellations rearranging themselves into meaningless diagrams nobody asked for, stretching across the surface like a map to nowhere, just meandering lines crossing over each other without any attempt at order, but it hardly matters because the light coming in is tinted by something unseen, giving everything a subtle lavender haze that clings to surfaces like an indecisive dream lingering past its welcome, weaving between threads of thoughts about uneven footsteps tapping across a hollow floor or the distant drone of an appliance trying to recall its original purpose, humming sporadically like a creature clearing its throat before falling silent again, letting the soft murmurs of passing nonsense collect in corners like misplaced marbles rolling gently against one another until they settle in a loose cluster that doesn’t signify anything at all except the simple fact that things tend to gather when left unattended, much like the stray impressions of drifting colors, faint chiming sounds, the odd sensation of cool metal against warm fingertips, or the recollection of a shape that never fully forms but remains suspended somewhere between a remembered smell and a fading echo, swirling lazily through the open space where one thought slips into another without any clear reason, dissolving into something else entirely before it has the chance to define itself, just a constant tumble of irrelevant fragments bumping gently against the next, flowing endlessly like a slow river with no destination, carrying bits of unanchored imagery in its current while the whole scene stretches further into its own shapeless expanse, wandering without pause, without pattern, simply continuing because continuation itself feels as light and unburdened as a drifting scrap of paper riding a breeze that refuses to choose a direction.
